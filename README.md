# The Dot Net Info

Simple client-side application that displays .NET news titles from other blogs. The Dot Net Info does not show any content from the original author. It displays only title, published date and author name. Since it is only a client-side app if the author has CORS policy it set up it could not be displayed.

## Installation 

### Dotnet

1. Clone or download the project
2. Build using Release configuration
3. Open cmd and navigate to LogApi\src\LogApi\LogApi\bin\Release\net5.0
4. Run:

```
dotnet LogApi.dll
```
5. Open a browser and navigate to: http://localhost:5000/requests.html

## Usage example

You can make any request to the port that you setup the project. It will collect information about the request and you can then see this information realtime by navigating to the /requests.html page.

The web api also has a background job which by default triggers every 10 mins. This job cleans the oldest requests in order to prevent ever growing memory. You are free to change this trigger time using the configs.

The application also has a session. It will disconnect the user after 30 mins. You can change that value too.

### Configs

You can override any of the configs by changing them in appSettings.json or through environment variables.

| Parameter  | Default Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| SocketAliveMinutes  | 30  | How long you will remain connected to the socket.  |
| RequestCleanerInMinutes  |  10  | How often should the cleaner run. |
| MaximumRequestsToKeep  | 1000 | How many requests to keep after the cleaner. |
